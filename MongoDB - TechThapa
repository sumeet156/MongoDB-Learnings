   # SQL vs MongoDB
     - SQL (Structured query language): Stores data in table format (rows and columns) / db are relational dbs
                                    suited for well-defined schemas and fixed data structures
           Ex. E-commerce platform, HR Management(payrolls) etc
               MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
  
     - MongoDB: NoSQL db are non-relational database. They Provide flexibility in data storage, allows varied data types and structures.
                Ideal for applications with dynamic or evolving data models.
                CMS, Social media platforms, Gaming
           Ex. MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis

• MongoDb Teminology and Advantages: 

     Database -> Collections (we can have multiple documents) -> Students / teachers / Products (Collection) -> Student ka alag doc hota hai teacher ka alag there details etc.
        it can be schemaless too
      

• Key Features:
   #Flexible Schema Designs, Scalability and performance, Document oriented storage, Dynamic quries, aggregation framework, Open Source and community
  
•  How works? -> Frontend + Backend + DB (Storage Engine- to talk with Db and do crud operations)
