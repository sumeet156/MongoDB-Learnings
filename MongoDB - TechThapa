• What is MongoDB?
   OpenSource, Doc-oriented(document store/ db that store information in doc.) NoSQL db management system         
   It is stored in JSON(JavaScript Object Notation)
   Designed for flexibility,scalability, and performance in handling unstructured or semi-structured data. 
   
• More about MongoDB : created by 10gen later changed to MongoDB (2009). Humongous (big derived from this) - Mongo

   # SQL vs MongoDB
     - SQL (Structured query language): Stores data in table format (rows and columns) / db are relational dbs
                                    suited for well-defined schemas and fixed data structures
           Ex. E-commerce platform, HR Management(payrolls) etc
               MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
  
     - MongoDB: NoSQL db are non-relational database. They Provide flexibility in data storage, allows varied data types and structures.
                Ideal for applications with dynamic or evolving data models.
                CMS, Social media platforms, Gaming
           Ex. MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis
          Inside one collection we can have multiple documents

• MongoDb Teminology and Advantages: 

     Database -> Collections (we can have multiple documents) -> Students / teachers / Products (Collection) -> Student ka alag doc hota hai teacher ka alag there details etc.
        it can be schemaless too
      

• Key Features:
   #Flexible Schema Designs, Scalability and performance, Document oriented storage, Dynamic quries, aggregation framework, Open Source and community
  
•  How works? -> Frontend + Backend + DB - MongoShell se bhi connect karke kar sakte hai (Storage Engine [Converts JSON to BSON]- to talk with Db and do crud operations)

• JSON vs BSON :
  - In MongoDB, we write in JSON format only but behind the scene data is stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format, a binary reprepntation of JSON.
  - By utilizing BSON, MongoDB can achieve higher read and write speeds, reduced storage requirements, and improved data manipulation capabilities,
  making it well-suited for handling large and complex datasets while maintaining performance efficiency.
  - JSON is easy to read and write
